# MachineLearninginR
Machine Learning Assignments from R for Data Science course
\
In this course we covered concepts and R libraries to both help us deal with data issues before training machine learning and about various machine learning algorithms.
\
Before training, a few things we were told to check include:
* missing values through multiple imputations
* find out whether our data is skewed and how to fix that skewness through diffrent transformations(Box-Cox, Tukey, logarithmic, cube/square root Transformations, data normlization/ standardization)
* Assumptions for Valid Linear Regression, Descriptive Statistics for Exploratory Data Analysis, among other things
\
We experimented with the following Machine Learning Algorithms:
* Linear and Logisitic Regression
* Regression Trees
* KNN
* Naive Bayes
* Kmeans and Hierarchical Clustering
* Introductory Text Mining

For Assignment 1 of the course, we covered basic data cleaning, missing value imputations, writing functions in R to filter, mutate and select specific variables
\
For Assignment 2 of the course, the following libraries were used for analysis:
* tidyverse, dplyr, lmtest, ggplot2, rcompanion, MASS, and corrplot
We merged datasets, performed data cleaning, drew graphs and histograms to test for skewness, performed Shapiro-Wilkes to test for normality, performed linear regression, analyzed residuals for normality,
